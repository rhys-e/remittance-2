# Remittance
B9labs Project 2

- Alice creates a Remittance contract with Ether in it and a puzzle.
- Alice sends a one-time-password to Bob; over SMS, say.
- Alice sends another one-time-password to Carol; over email, say.
- Bob treks to Carol's shop.
- Bob gives Carol his one-time-password.
- Carol submits both passwords to Alice's remittance contract.
- Only when both passwords are correct, the contract yields the Ether to Carol.
- Carol gives the local currency to Bob.
- Bob leaves.
- Alice is notified that the transaction went through.
